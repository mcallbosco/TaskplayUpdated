Taskplay is a small utility which adds media playback controls to the Windows System Tray. This fork adds many essential features such as automatically updating the playing icon if you play or pause something, the ability to hide specific buttons, and the ability to have the song seek icons hidden while nothing is playing.

## Info
Taskplay is written in C#

This version of taskplay has been updated to use the Contracks SDK to grab if anything is playing, so it requires a minimum of Windows 10 version 1903 and .Net framework 4.7.2

## Download
To download Taskplay, please go to the Releases tab of this repository.
